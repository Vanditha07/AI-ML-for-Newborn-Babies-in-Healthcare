## Input Video files and Python Script for Extracting Images  

The **videos** folder contains Videos 37-39 from the NoPain folder of the data set from which the images have to be extracted.  

**Extract Frames.ipynb** is the Python notebook which contains the code to extract 50 RGB and 50 Grayscale images from the input video files. The code is well commented and is explained clearly in the notebook itself.
